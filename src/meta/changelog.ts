Projected into 3-D those fibres become nested, interlocking tori: the ground-state texture of a topological soliton that really appears in ferromagnets, superfluids, knotted light and vortex knots.

    "summary": "The same self-organizing map, handed a harder problem: a branching vascular tree instead of a smooth sphere. A flat rectangular lattice can't wrap around every bifurcation while keeping all its neighbours consistent — so the sheet stretches, compresses and tears near the branch points. What looks like the algorithm struggling is really it revealing the limits of topology preservation.",
