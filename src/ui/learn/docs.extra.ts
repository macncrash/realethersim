    about:
      'Lenia generalises Conway’s Game of Life to a continuous world: smooth space, smooth time, and smooth states in [0,1] instead of on/off cells. From this continuity emerge astonishingly lifelike "creatures" — gliders, rotors, and self-repairing cells that swim and interact. Discovered by Bert Chan in 2019.',
    howItWorks:
      'Each step the field is convolved with a smooth ring-shaped kernel to measure each cell’s local neighbourhood density U; a bell-shaped growth function then grows cells where U is near μ and decays them otherwise. A [0,1] clamp keeps it bounded.',
