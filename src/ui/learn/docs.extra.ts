    title: 'Lenia',
    about:
      'Lenia generalises Conway’s Game of Life to a continuous world: smooth space, smooth time, and smooth states in [0,1] instead of on/off cells. From this continuity emerge astonishingly lifelike "creatures" — gliders, rotors, and self-repairing cells that swim and interact. Discovered by Bert Chan in 2019.',
    howItWorks:
      'Each step the field is convolved with a smooth ring-shaped kernel to measure each cell’s local neighbourhood density U; a bell-shaped growth function then grows cells where U is near μ and decays them otherwise. A [0,1] clamp keeps it bounded.',

    title: 'Diffusion-Limited Aggregation',
    about:
      'DLA models growth by random diffusion: particles wander randomly until they bump into a growing cluster, then stick permanently. From a single seed this builds a branching, self-similar dendrite — the same process behind coral, frost on a window, lightning, mineral veins, and electrodeposition. The result is a fractal with dimension ≈ 1.71.',
    howItWorks:
      'Many walkers random-walk across the grid; whenever a walker lands next to the cluster it freezes there (with probability "stickiness"), then a fresh walker is released. Lower stickiness lets walkers penetrate deeper, giving denser, bushier growth.',

      'A piecewise-linear cousin of the Hénon map: swap the x² term for |x|. That sharp absolute value turns the smooth Hénon curve into an attractor built from straight segments — and made the Lozi map one of the first strange attractors proven rigorously to be chaotic.',
